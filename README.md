FizzBuzz Challenge
Loop over numbers 1-100
If the number is divisible by 3, log the word 'Fizz' to the console
If the number is divisible by 5, log the word 'Buzz' to the console
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, log the word 'FizzBuzz' to the console
If the number is not divisible by either, log the number to the console
